Python port for the Terminal Jam Reboot
<https://itch.io/jam/terminal-jam-reboot> of a C++ game is wrote in 2008

'SinkTheShip' is similar to Battle Ship.

The object of the game is to sink the ship.  There will be one ship 
on the grid.  The player will choose horizontal and virtical coordinates 
and the game will calculate whether those coordiantes were a hit or a 
miss.  An "X" will mark a hit and "*" a miss.  The difficulty levels 
will be set as follows;

 - Easy will be a grid of 10 x 10
 - Normal will be a grid of 15 x 15
 - Hard will be a grid of 20 x 20

You will have 15, 20, and 25 attempts, respectively, to sink the ship.
If you do not, the ship will escape and you lose.
You may exit the game at any time by hitting "Ctrl-C".
