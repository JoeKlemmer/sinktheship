Sink the Ship

Python port for the Terminal Jam Reboot
<https:itch.io/jam/terminal-jam-reboot> of a C++ game is wrote in 2008

'SinkTheShip' is similar to Battle Ship.

The object of the game is to sink the ship. There will be one ship on the
grid. The player will choose horizontal and vertical coordinates and the game
will calculate whether those coordinates were a hit or a miss. An "X" will
mark a hit and "*" a miss. The default levels are set as so;

    Easy will be a grid of 10 by 10
    Normal will be a grid of 15 by 15
    Hard will be a grid of 20 by 20
